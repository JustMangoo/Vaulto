      <h2>6. Suspension &amp; Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to Vaulto if you breach these

          When feasible, we will provide advance notice of suspension along with

      <h2>7. Disclaimers &amp; Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Vaulto is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We strive to
        keep the Services reliable, but we cannot guarantee uninterrupted or
        error-free operation. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim
        all warranties and liability for any indirect, incidental, or
        consequential damages arising from your use of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our total liability for claims arising out of or related to these terms
        is limited to the greater of €50 or the amounts you paid to Vaulto in
        the twelve months preceding the event giving rise to the claim. Some
        jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so the
        above may not apply to you.
