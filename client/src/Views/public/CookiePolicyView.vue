      <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your device when you
        visit a website or use a web application. They enable features such as
        signing in, remembering preferences, and analyzing how a product is used.
        Other technologies—like pixels, local storage, or software development
        kits—may perform similar functions. We refer to all of these collectively
        as “cookies.”
